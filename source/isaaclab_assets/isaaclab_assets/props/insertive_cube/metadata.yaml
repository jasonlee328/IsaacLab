# Metadata for cube asset
# This defines the positioning and assembly offsets for the cube

# Offset when the cube is assembled/inserted into a goal position
assembled_offset:
  pos: [0.0, 0.0, -0.02]  # Alignment point at bottom of cube (2cm down from center)
  quat: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Identity rotation

# Offset from cube center to bottom surface (for proper placement on surfaces)
bottom_offset:
  pos: [0.0, 0.0, -0.02]  # Half the height of a 5cm cube
  quat: [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Must be identity rotation

# Optional: Target mesh path for collision detection
# Not needed for cube as the mesh is at the root prim
