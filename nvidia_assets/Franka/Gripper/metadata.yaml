# Distance from gripper base (robotiq_arg2f_base_link) to TCP along approach direction
# The TCP is 174mm along -Z from the base link (matching gripper_offset)
# With approach_direction=[0,0,1], we need negative offset:
#   standoff_translation = [0,0,1] * -(-0.174) = [0,0,0.174]
#   gripper_base = object_center + [0,0,0.174]
#   TCP = gripper_base + [0,0,-0.174] = object_center ✓
