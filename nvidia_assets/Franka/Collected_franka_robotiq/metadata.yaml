# Robotiq 2F-85 Gripper Metadata
# Offset information for frame tracking

gripper_offset:
  # Offset from panda_link7 (wrist flange) to gripper tip (TCP = 174mm)
  # NOTE: Use NEGATIVE z-offset because panda_link7's local z-axis points backward (toward robot base)
  # The TCP is 174mm away from the flange in the direction opposite to the local +z axis
  # This applies to Franka robots with Robotiq 2F-85 gripper attached
